# Insta360 Pro HLS Viewer

Very simple application for viewing HLS stream from Insta360 Pro.

## Setup

1. Replace `INSTA360_ADDRESS`'s value to your Insta360 Pro's IP address. This is in `app/src/main/java/com.eje_c.hlsview.App`. See this file.
2. Put your [osig files](https://dashboard.oculus.com/tools/osig-generator/) into `app/src/main/assets` directory.
